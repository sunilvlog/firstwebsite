        <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled and funded by the government at three levels: 
            central, state and local) and private schools. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, 
            free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. 
            The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.

            Unlike other countries Private Schools are more common among middle class families.
            
            After primary education, students will enter primary education in the age group of 8–11 years, 
            where they will study in classes 3–5. Teachers will put more emphasis on the students; health, analytical skills, mathematical approach, 
            reasoning, logical thinking and creative thinking. Classes will be more engaging and pedantic than book-based learning.</p>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Tranforming Education of india</p>
        <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary education. In 2011, 
            Approximately 75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate.India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[6] 
            Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. 
            While enrollment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a gross enrollment ratio of 24% in 2013 
            there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations
            a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.

            At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, 
            with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.Certain post-secondary technical schools are also private. 
            The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market</p>

        <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural children between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. 
            This is the fourth annual survey to report enrollment above 96%. India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this age group from year 2007 to 2014. 
            As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6-14 who are not enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the year academic year 2018 (ASER 2018).
            [11] Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, 
            from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 2.3 million students over 2002 total enrolment, and a 19% increase in girl's enrolment.[12] 
            While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system. 
            While more than 95 percent of children attend primary school, just 40 percent of Indian adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9-12). 
            Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2 billion to education in India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of teachers every day.
            States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such schools.</p>
